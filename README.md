Build with Dagger + Rxjava + Retrofit + MVVM

*Please notice that I will add my own LaunchView inside it

1.pull up to refresh the data
2.wrap the Api as a model 
3.Databinding with whole data, except onClick Action.
  The Reason that I didn't do it is that I wish ViewModel
  can be easy to be Test (Unit Test).

4.Utilize contraintlayout to prevent nest problem
5.Use Rxjava as a callback fun and control the thread
6.Use Dagger to do the Dependence Inject. Additionally,
  Dagger allows me to bind data with activity lifecycle
  
If there are somewhere for me to improve.
Please feel free to tell me~
